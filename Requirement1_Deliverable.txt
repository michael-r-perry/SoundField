The Emotive headset ended up winning because we found out,
that we didn't care about having as many electrodes as possible 
like we though we might. The three biggests pros for the emotiv
headset are that it has the temporal resolution of (1 ms), 
can be set up an ran within 10 minutes, and has propritary 
software to record EEG data for us.
